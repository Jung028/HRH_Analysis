# HRH Performance Analysis & Prediction for Cycling 

## Objectives  
- Analyze trends in **Resting Heart Rate (RHR)**, **power output**, **cadence**, and **speed** over time.  
- Identify correlations between **heart rate, power efficiency, and speed** using data visualizations.  
- Predict future **RHR trends** using **Linear Regression** to assess training effectiveness.  
- Provide insights into cardiovascular performance and training adaptation for optimization.

## Features  

### Data Visualization  
- **Resting Heart Rate (RHR) Trends** over time.  
- **Heart Rate vs. Power Output** analysis.  
- **Cadence vs. Speed Relationship** visualization.  
- **Peak Power Output Trends** tracking.  

### Predictive Analysis  
- Implements **Linear Regression** to predict future **Avg BPM (Resting Heart Rate)**.  
- Assesses whether the **RHR trend is improving or declining**.
